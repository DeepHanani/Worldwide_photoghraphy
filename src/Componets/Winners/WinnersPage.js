    <h4>JENS CULLMANN, GERMANY - GOLD WINNER AND GRAND PRIZE OF WORLD NATURE PHOTOGRAPHER OF THE YEAR</h4>
    <p>This photograph is the result of my staking out the largest pool in Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe, at a time when an extended drought had reduced the pool to rapidly-drying mud. I had to be very careful not to disturb the crocodile, even though it was buried in dry mud. They will launch themselves with tremendous speed and power at any animal foolish enough to come too close.</p>

    <h4>GOLD: HIDETOSHI OGATA, JAPAN</h4>
    <p>Japanese macaques on Awaji Island in Japan form huddles consisting of many individual monkeys, sometimes reaching more than thirty. In other places, huddles are usually made up of just a few, rarely more than ten. Cuddling and grooming are among several possible reasons for making a huddle. It begins with the mother and baby cuddling. Other females and young males then join in, as well as other cuddling groups. This photo captures a rare moment during the lactation season when three pairs of monkeys have formed a huddle after grooming. Most Awaji monkeys are non-aggressive and when they are raising their babies, mothers create individual communities that have no social hierarchies. </p>
